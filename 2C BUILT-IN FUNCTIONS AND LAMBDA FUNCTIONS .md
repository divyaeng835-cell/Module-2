## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS- RELATED TO THE GIVEN EXPRESSION
### AIM  
To write a Python program to calculate the value of the following expression by using lambda function.
The expression is - (x + 10) + (y + 2) + z

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Input three integers x,y and z from the user  
3. Define a lambda function sum that:
4. The lambda function compares the numbers and prints:
   - take three arguments x,y,and z.
   - computes the expression
5. Print the result
6. Terminate the program.

---

### PROGRAM
```
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
z = int(input())

expr = lambda x, y, z: (x + 10) + (y + 2) + z
print(expr(x, y, z))

```
