# Exp.No:2e  
## SEB - DEFINE A FUNCTION AND RETURN SUM,SUBTRACTION,MULTIPLICATION
### AIM  
To write a Python program to define a function named "result" that accepts 2 values and return its sum, subtraction and multiplication.
### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Input the base number (`base`) from the user.  
3. Input the exponent number (`exp`) from the user.  
4. Use the built-in `pow()` function to compute the base raised to the power of the exponent.  
5. Print the result using the `print()` function, displaying the power in a formatted output.  
6. Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
```
def result(a,b):
    c=a+b
    d=a-b
    e=a*b
    print(f"Sum is {c},Sub is {d},&Multiply is {e}")
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
```

### RESULT
Thus the python program to return its sum, subtraction and multiplication using function has been implemented and executed successfully.
